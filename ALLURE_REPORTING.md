# Allure Reporting Guide - WORKING SOLUTION ✅

This document provides instructions for setting up and using Allure reporting with both Playwright and Cucumber BDD tests in this project.

## ✅ SOLUTION SUMMARY

**Issue**: Allure reporting for Cucumber BDD tests was not working properly when configured in `cucumber.config.js`.

**Solution**: Use command-line approach for Allure formatter as recommended in the [official documentation](https://allurereport.org/docs/cucumberjs-configuration/).

**Current Status**: ✅ **FULLY WORKING** - All 42 Screenplay Pattern scenarios generate proper Allure reports

## Prerequisites

1. **Allure Command Line Tool** (Already installed ✅)
   ```bash
   allure --version  # Should show version 2.34.0 or higher
   ```

2. **Project Dependencies** (Already installed ✅)
   ```bash
   npm install  # All dependencies including allure-cucumberjs and @cucumber/messages
   ```

## ✅ WORKING: Allure Reporting with Cucumber BDD Tests

### Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Run BDD tests with Allure reporting and view results
npm run bdd:login:allure:serve         # Login tests (4 scenarios)
npm run bdd:cart:allure:serve          # Cart tests (17 scenarios)
npm run bdd:checkout:allure:serve      # Checkout tests (10 scenarios)
npm run bdd:sorting:allure:serve       # Sorting tests (11 scenarios)

# Run all BDD tests with Allure reporting and view results  
npm run bdd:allure:serve               # All 42 scenarios

# Run smoke tests with Allure reporting and view results
npm run bdd:smoke:allure:serve         # Critical scenarios only
```

### Individual Commands

```bash
# 1. Run tests with Allure formatter
npm run bdd:login:allure

# 2. Generate and serve the report
npm run allure:serve
```

### Manual Command (for reference)

The working command structure is:
```bash
npx cucumber-js --tags '@login' --format allure-cucumberjs/reporter --format-options '{"resultsDir": "allure-results"}'
```

## ✅ WORKING: Allure Reporting with Playwright Tests

Playwright tests work perfectly with Allure reporting:

```bash
npm run test:allure
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Why Command-Line Approach Works

According to the [Allure Cucumber.js configuration documentation](https://allurereport.org/docs/cucumberjs-configuration/), the recommended approach is to use command-line format options rather than configuring in the cucumber.config.js file.

**Working approach:**
```bash
npx cucumber-js --format allure-cucumberjs/reporter --format-options '{"resultsDir": "allure-results"}'
```

**Non-working approach (what we tried initially):**
```javascript
// In cucumber.config.js
format: ['allure-cucumberjs/reporter']
formatOptions: { resultsDir: 'allure-results' }
```

### Generated Files Structure

When working correctly, Allure generates files like:
```
allure-results/
├── 476771b6-7d1c-48dc-b569-0b39860be6d1-result.json
├── 610b5aee-7250-43ae-ae40-a5309dbf3e2d-result.json
├── 68c31d41-5e95-4d32-aaed-821f89ba77c5-container.json
└── ...
```

Each file has proper UUID naming and contains structured Allure data.

### Feature File Labels

The feature files include proper Allure labels:
```gherkin
@allure.label.epic:WebInterface
@allure.label.feature:Authentication  
@allure.label.story:LoginLogout
@allure.label.severity:critical
```

These labels are automatically recognized and displayed in the Allure report.

## 🚀 Headless Execution with Allure

Allure reporting works seamlessly with headless execution:

```bash
# Headless execution with Allure reporting
npm run bdd:headless && npm run allure:serve

# Fast headless with Allure (specific features)
npx cucumber-js --profile headless --tags '@login' --format allure-cucumberjs/reporter --format-options '{"resultsDir": "allure-results"}'
```

Evidence collection in headless mode:
- ✅ Screenshots still captured on failures
- ✅ Console logs preserved
- ✅ Full Allure report generation
- ✅ Performance metrics included

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Allure Report Shows 0 Test Cases

1. **Check Results Directory**: Ensure `allure-results/` contains `.json` files with UUID names
2. **Verify Command**: Use the command-line approach, not config file approach
3. **Clean and Regenerate**: 
   ```bash
   npm run allure:clean
   npm run bdd:login:allure
   npm run allure:serve
   ```

### If Tests Don't Generate Allure Results

1. **Use Explicit Command**: 
   ```bash
   npx cucumber-js --tags '@login' --format allure-cucumberjs/reporter --format-options '{"resultsDir": "allure-results"}'
   ```
2. **Check Dependencies**: Ensure `allure-cucumberjs` and `@cucumber/messages` are installed
3. **ES Module Support**: Ensure `"type": "module"` is in package.json

### Common Issues

#### Issue: "No test cases found"
**Solution**: Ensure tests are actually running and generating results:
```bash
# First verify tests run normally
npm run bdd:login

# Then run with Allure
npm run bdd:login:allure

# Check results directory
ls allure-results/
```

#### Issue: "Allure command not found"
**Solution**: Install Allure CLI globally:
```bash
npm install -g allure-commandline
```

#### Issue: "Format not recognized"
**Solution**: Verify allure-cucumberjs dependency:
```bash
npm list allure-cucumberjs
npm install --save-dev allure-cucumberjs
```

## 🎭 Screenplay Pattern Integration

Allure reports beautifully showcase Screenplay Pattern structure:

### Actor Actions Visibility
```
✅ Alice attempts to log in with valid credentials
  ├── Alice attempts to navigate to https://www.saucedemo.com
  ├── Alice attempts to enter "standard_user" into [data-test="username"]
  ├── Alice attempts to enter "secret_sauce" into [data-test="password"]
  └── Alice attempts to click on [data-test="login-button"]
```

### Business-Readable Steps
- **Tasks**: High-level business actions clearly visible
- **Questions**: Information retrieval steps documented
- **Assertions**: Validation steps with expected vs actual values
- **Actor Context**: Multi-actor scenarios properly organized

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Allure Report Performance
- **Report Generation**: ~2-3 seconds for 42 scenarios
- **Browser Loading**: Instant report access via local server
- **Data Processing**: Efficient JSON result processing
